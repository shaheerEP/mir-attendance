Here is the summary of your options:

Online Snapshot (Current Plan):
Pros: Most accurate, unlimited students, easy to manage.
Cons: Needs constant WiFi, slower (5-8s per student).
Best For: Reliable attendance where immediate feedback ("Welcome Shaheer") is needed.
Offline Edge Mode (On-Device):
Pros: Fast (1s), completely offline during class.
Cons: Very Low Capacity (Max 10-20 students due to RAM), lower accuracy.
Verdict: Not suitable for a full class unless you use complex SD card paging.
Hybrid / Bulk Capture (SD Card):
Pros: Fastest (0.5s click-to-click). Robust (doesn't care about WiFi).
Cons: "Blind" Capture. You won't know if the face was recognized until you sync at the end of the day. No "Welcome" message on screen.
Verdict: Best backup plan.
